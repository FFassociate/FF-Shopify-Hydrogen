              We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit

              Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), 
              that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. 
              You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of 
              your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the 
              address of the web page.

              customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable 
              information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
